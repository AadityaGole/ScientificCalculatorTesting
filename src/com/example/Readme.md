# Scientific Calculator (Java)

This project implements a comprehensive **Scientific Calculator** written entirely in Java.  
It is designed to support **unit testing** (JUnit) and **mutation testing** (e.g., PIT), as required in software quality and testing-focused coursework.

The calculator includes arithmetic, scientific operations, date utilities, statistical functions, binary search algorithms, and many additional helper methods to reach **1000+ lines of code**.
